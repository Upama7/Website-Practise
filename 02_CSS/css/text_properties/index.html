    <h1>Cuttle Fish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are <a href="nowhere">marine</a> molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the
        class
        Cephalopoda,
        which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.

    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from the
        Late Maastrichtian-Paleocene.[8] Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the
        Octopodiformes, remains unclear.[9]

    <h3>Range and habitat</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are
        mostly shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have
        an unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and
        the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas

    <h4>Anatomy and physiology</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial similarities
        between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil
        is a smoothly curving W-shape.[15][16] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[17] they can perceive the
        polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast.
