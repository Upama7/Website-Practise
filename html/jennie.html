            <h2>Early life</h2>

            <p>Jennie Kim was born in Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul[3] on January 16, 1996, as an only child.[4][5]
                She initially attended Cheongdam Elementary School in Seoul before moving to New Zealand.[6] When she
                was eight years old, she went on a trip with her family to Australia and New Zealand. When her mother
                asked her if she liked New Zealand and wanted to stay, Jennie replied "yes"; one year later, she was
                sent to study at Waikowhai Intermediate School in Auckland and lived with a home-stay family.[7] Jennie
                spoke about her experience learning a new language on the MBC's documentary English, Must Change to
                Survive (2006).<sup>[8]</sup> During her adolescent years, she dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer.[9]
                After
                completing intermediate, she enrolled at ACG Parnell College.[7]
            </p>


            <p>Jennie first heard of K-pop while in New Zealand, particularly finding an interest in YG Entertainment's
                music.[10] Her mother planned to move her to Florida in the United States at the age of 14 to continue
                her studies to become a lawyer or teacher; however, she did not like the idea and was concerned about
                not finding work she liked while living alone. Her family supported her decision, and she moved back
                to South Korea in 2010, where she studied at Cheongdam Middle School.[11][10][12] Jennie auditioned
                for YG Entertainment that same year with Rihanna's "Take a Bow", succeeding in joining the label as a
                trainee.[13] Through High Cut Korea, she revealed because she was afraid of strangers and reluctant to
                take initiative, she could barely introduce herself during her audition.[14]
            <aside>Initially a vocalist, the
                company believed she should embrace the role of a rapper as most songs she covered included raps and
                she was the only trainee fluent in English at the time.[15][16]
